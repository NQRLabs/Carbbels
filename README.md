# Carbbels
Carbbels is a manual anagram sandbox for creative wordplay and puzzle-solving. Type letters to generate draggable tiles, arrange them freely, and explore spatial patterns. Copy visual sequences, undo/redo moves, align and group tiles, and experiment with layout to uncover hidden meanings. Ideal for ARGs, ciphers, and discovery through play.
