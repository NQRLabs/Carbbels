# Carbbels

Carbbels is a manual anagram sandbox designed for puzzle-solving and exploratory wordplay. It is intentionally not a game. Instead, it is a flexible workspace where letters can be typed, dragged, grouped, visually reordered, copied into different sequences, and used for puzzle deduction. Originally built to support an Alternate Reality Game (ARG).

## Features

### Text and Tile Sync
- Typing automatically creates draggable letter tiles
- Deleting in the textbox removes the corresponding tiles
- Dragging or deleting tiles updates the textbox
- Pasting multiple characters spreads tiles into free positions

### Sandbox Interaction
- Drag single or multiple tiles freely across the grid
- Box-select to select groups quickly
- Ctrl + Click to toggle individual tiles in the selection
- Selection persists across movement
- Snap-free movement helps experimental layouts

### Puzzle Tools
- `G`: Group selected tiles horizontally
- `H`: Evenly distribute selected tiles horizontally
- `V`: Evenly distribute selected tiles vertically
- Arrow keys: Align tiles to a shared axis

### Copy Visual Order
- **Ctrl + Shift + C**: Copy tile letters in visual left-to-right, top-to-bottom order

### Undo / Redo
- **Ctrl + Z**: Undo last action
- **Ctrl + Y**: Redo undone action

## Why Carbbels Exists

Carbbels was created for situations where:
- Layout conveys meaning
- Words may need physical reordering
- Discovery happens through experimentation

Tiles remain movable objects rather than fixed positions.

> Some puzzles reveal their answers only when you move the letters around.

Created for puzzle solvers, game designers, and curious thinkers interested in the deeper meaning that emerges when letters can move.

If you use Carbbels in a puzzle or ARG, I’d love to hear about it.
